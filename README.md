Finite detector size atteneuation factor calculator for GRIFFIN
Method1: For each parameter the calculator returns value from the fit function and the standard way of error propagation. The erorr propagation did not includes covariance hence it is not a proper error and should not being used.
Method2: value from the root output directly with confidence level sigma. 
The dataset has an energy interval of 5keV, if the input value is not integer of 5, the code will find the closest value. 
Note: It takes roughly 5s to updated the result using search method
